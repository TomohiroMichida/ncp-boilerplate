# NCP Boilerplate

NCP Boilerplate is a monorepo-based microservices development template built with Next.js, Chakra UI, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.  
It focuses on development efficiency and scalability, providing a foundation designed for seamless framework replacement and smooth migration to production environments.

- [Setup Guide](./docs/setup.md)
- [Prisma Model Design Guide](./docs/prisma.md)

## 🛠️ Project Architecture (Docker Containers + Ports + Protocols)

Each service is managed in an independent Docker container based on its responsibilities. Thanks to its loosely coupled architecture and clear separation of concerns, the system remains flexible for both local development and future scaling.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **frontend** : Next.js, Chakra UI
- **backend** : Express
- **service** : Express, Prisma (ORM)
- **database** : PostgreSQL

## 💡 Features

- **Monorepo Structure**

  - Designed to manage each service (frontend / backend / service) independently within a single repository.  
    Combines the efficiency of monorepo management with the flexibility of a microservices architecture.

- **Dependency Management with pnpm Workspaces**

  - All service dependencies are centrally managed using pnpm workspaces.  
    This enables smoother and faster development, build, and deployment processes, providing a scalable structure.

- **Code Quality Management**

  - Integrated with ESLint v9, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged to automatically trigger lint checks **before commits**.  
    Potential issues are detected before pushing to remote repositories, maintaining consistently high code quality.
  - **Unit Testing** pre‑installed—Jest + @testing‑library.<br>Run all: `pnpm test`   *Per service*: `pnpm test:frontend`, etc.

- **Extensibility**

  - Both the backend and service layers are strictly separated by responsibility, maintaining a minimal yet production-ready structure suitable for scalable growth.
  - All Express-specific logic is isolated within the `routes` layer, while subsequent layers are composed entirely of framework-agnostic, pure TypeScript classes. This enables seamless migration to frameworks such as **Hono**, **Fastify**, or **NestJS** by simply replacing the routing layer.
  - The repository layer is designed around interface-based abstraction and constructor-driven dependency injection (DI), facilitating testability and ease of implementation replacement.

- **Seamless Transition to Production Environments**
  - Designed to easily switch between development and production environments.  
    `.env` management and Docker containerization enable a smooth workflow from local development to production release.

## CI / CD

| Type   | Status           | Details                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI** | **✅ Enabled**   | GitHub Actions automatically runs `lint → typecheck → test → build`.<br>`pnpm‑store` is cached by lockfile hash for speed.    |
| **CD** | **Not included** | Deployment targets differ per project (Vercel / Render / ECS / Fly.io, …), so CD is intentionally **left to template users**. |
